                   Log of Changes Made to CFITSIO

Version 2.1 - 26 Sept 2000

  Enhancements

   - made substantial modification to the code to support Large files,
     i.e., files larger than 2**31 bytes = 2.1GB.  FITS files up to
     6 terabytes in size may now be read and written on platforms
     that support Large files (currently only Solaris).

   - modified ffpcom and ffphis, which write COMMENT and HISTORY 
     keywords, respectively, so that they now use columns 9 - 80, 
     instead of only columns 11 - 80.  Previously, these routines
     avoided using columns 9 and 10, but this is was unnecessarily
     restrictive.

   - modified ffdhdu so that instead of refusing to delete the 
     primary array, it will replace the current primary array 
     with a null primary array containing the bare minimum of
     required keywords and no data.

  New Routines

   - fits_read_pix, fits_read_pixnull, fits_read_subset, and fits_write_pix
     routines were added to enable reading and writing of Large images,
     with more than 2.1e9 pixels.  These new routines are now recommended
     as the basic routines for reading and writing all images.

   - fits_get_hduoff returns the byte offset in the file to
     the start and end of the current HDU.  This routine replaces the
     now obsolete fits_get_hduaddr routine;  it uses 'off_t' instead of
     'long' as the datatype of the arguments and can support offsets
     in files greater than 2.1GB in size.

  Bug fixes:

   - improved ffptbb, the low-level table writing routine, so that 
     it will insert additional rows in the table if the table is
     not already big enough.  Previously it would have just over-
     written any HDUs following the table in the FITS file.

   - fixed a bug in the  fits_write_col_bit/ffpclx routine which
     could not write to a bit 'X' column if that was the first column
     in the table to be written to.  This bug would not appear if
     any other datatype column was written to first.

   - nonsensible (but still formally legal) binary table TFORM values
     such as '8A15', or '1A8' or 'A8' would confuse CFITSIO and cause it
     to return a 308 error.  When parsing the TFORMn = 'rAw' value,
     the ffbnfm routine has been modified to ignore the 'w' value in cases 
     where w > r.

   - fixed bug in the blsearch routine in iraffits.c which sometimes
     caused an out-of-bounds string pointer to be returned when searching
     for blank space in the header just before the 'END' keyword.

   - fixed minor problem in ffgtcr in group.c, which sometimes failed
     while trying to move to the end of file before appending a
     grouping table.

   - on Solaris, with Sun CC 5.0, one must check for '__unix' rather
     than '__unix__' or 'unix' as it's symbol.  Needed to modify this
     in drvrfile.c in 3 places.

   - in ffextn, the FITS file would be left open if the named
     extension doesn't exist, thus preventing the file from being
     opened again later with write access.

   - fixed bug in ffiimg that would cause attempts to insert a new
     image extension following a table extension, and in front of any
     other type of extension, to fail.

Version 2.037 - 6 July 2000

  Enhancements

   - added support in the extended filename syntax for flipping
     an image along any axis either by specifying a starting 
     section pixel number greater than the ending pixel number,
     or by using '-*' to flip the whole axis.  Examples:
     "myfile.fits[1:100, 50:10]" or "myfile.fits[-*,*]".

   - when reading a section of an image with the extended filename
     syntax (e.g. image.fits[1:100:2, 1:100:2), any CDi_j WCS keywords
     will be updated if necessary to transfer the world coordinate
     system from the imput image to the output image section.

   - on UNIX platforms, added support for filenames that begin
     with "~/" or "~user/".  The "~" symbol will get expanded
     into a string that gives the user's home directory.

   - changed the filename parser to support disk file names that
     begin with a minus sign.  Previously, the leading minus sign would
     cause CFITSIO to try to read/write the file from/to stdin/stdout.

   - modified the general fits_update_key routine, which writes
     or updates a keyword value, to use the 'G' display format
     instead of the 'E' format for floating point keyword values.
     This will eliminate trailing zeros from appearing in the value.

   - added support for the "-CAR" celestial coordinate projection
     in the ffwldp and ffxypx routines.  The "-CAR" projection is
     the default simplest possible linear projection.

   - added new fits_create_memfile/ffimem routine to create a new
     fits file at a designated memory location.

   - ported f77_wrap.h and f77_wrap1.c so that the Fortran interface
     wrappers work correctly on 64-bit SGI operating systems.  In this
     environment, C 'long's  are 8-bytes long, but Fortran 'integers'
     are still only 4-bytes long, so the words have to be converted
     by the wrappers.

   - minor modification to cfortran.h to automatically detect when it
     is running on a linux platform, and then define f2cFortran in that
     case.  This eliminates the need to define -Df2cFortran on the
     command line.

   - modified group.c to support multiple "/" characters in
     the path name of the file to be opened/created.

   - minor modifications to the parser (eval.y, eval_f.c, eval_y.c)
     to a) add the unary '+' operator, and b) support copying the
     TDIMn keyword from the input to the output image under certain
     circumstances.

   - modified the lexical parser in eval_l.y and eval_l.c to
     support #NULL and #SNULL constants which act to set the
     value to Null.  Support was also added for the C-conditional
     expression: 'boolean ? trueVal : falseVal'.

   - small modification to eval_f.c to write an error message to
     the error stack if numerical overflow occurs when evaluating
     an expression.

   - configure and configure.in now support the egcs g77 compiler
     on Linux platforms.

  Bug fixes:

   - fixed a significant bug when using the extended filename binning
     syntax to generate a 2-dimensional image from a histogram of the
     values in 2 table columns.  This bug would cause table events that
     should have been located in the row just below the bottom row of
     the image (and thus should have been excluded from the histogram)
     to be instead added into the first row of the image.  Similarly,
     the first plane of a 3-D or 4-D data cube would include the events
     that should have been excluded as falling in the previous plane of
     the cube.

   - fixed minor bug when parsing an extended filename that contains
     nested pairs of square brackets (e.g., '[col newcol=oldcol[9]]').

   - fixed bug when reading unsigned integer values from a table or
     image with fits_read_col_uint/ffgcvuk.  This bug only occurred on
     systems like Digital Unix (now Tru64 Unix) in which 'long'
     integers are 8 bytes long, and only when reading more than 7200
     elements at a time.  This bug would generally cause the program to
     crash with a segmentation fault.

   - modified ffgcpr to update 'heapstart' as well as 'numrows' when
     writing more rows beyond the end of the table.  heapstart
     is needed to calculate if more space needs to be inserted in the
     table when inserting columns into the table.

   - modified fficls (insert column), ffmvec, ffdrow and ffdcol to 
     not use the value of the NAXIS2 keyword as the number of rows
     in the table, and instead use the value that is stored in
     an internal structure, because the keyword value may not
     be up to date.

   - Fixed bug in the iterator function that affected the handling
     of null values in string columns in ASCII and binary tables.

   - Reading a subsample of pixels in very large images, (e.g., 
     file = myfile.fits[1:10000:10,1:10000:10],  could cause a
     long integer overflow (value > 2**31) in the computation of the
     starting byte offset in the file, and cause a return error status
     = 304 (negative byte address).  This was fixed by changing the
     order of the arithmetic operations in calculating the value of
     'readptr' in the ffgcli, ffgclj, ffgcle, ffgcld, etc. routines.

   - In version 2.031, a fix to prevent compressed files from being
     opened with write privilege was implemented incorrectly.  The fix
     was intended to not allow a compressed FITS file to be opened
     except when a local uncompressed copy of the file is being
     produced (then the copy is opened with write access), but in fact
     the opposite behavior occurred:  Compressed files could be opened
     with write access, EXCEPT when a local copy is produced.   This
     has been fixed in the mem_compress_open and file_compress_open
     routines.

   - in iraffits.c, a global variable called 'val' caused multiply
     defined symbols warning when linking cfitsio and IRAF libraries.
     This was fixed by making 'val' a local variable within the
     routine.

Version 2.036 - 1 Feb 2000

   - added 2 new generic routines, ffgpf and ffgcf which are analogous
     to ffgpv and ffgcv but return an array of null flag values instead
     of setting null pixels to a reserved value.

   - minor change to eval_y.c and eval.y to "define alloca malloc"
     on all platforms, not just VMS.

   - added support for the unsigned int datatype (TUINT) in the
     generic ffuky routine and changed ffpky so that unsigned ints
     are cast to double instead of long before being written to 
     the header. 

   - modified ffs2c so that if a null string is given as input then
     a null FITS string (2 successive single quotes) will be returned.
     Previously this routine would just return a string with a single
     quote, which could cause an illegal keyword record to be written.

   - The file flush operation on Windows platforms apparently
     changes the internal file position pointer (!) in violation of the
     C standard.  Put a patch into the file_flush routine to explicitly
     seek back to the original file position.

   - changed the name of imcomp_get_compressed_image_parms to
     imcomp_get_compressed_image_par to not exceed the 31 character
     limit on some compilers.

   - modified the filename parser (which is used when moving to a
     named HDU) to support EXTNAME values which contain embedded blanks.

   - modified drvrnet.c to deal with ftp compressed files better so
     that even fits files returned from cgi queries which have the wrong
     mime types and/or wrong types of file names should still decompress.

   - modified ffgics to reduce the tolerance for acceptable skewness
     between the axes, and added a new warning return status = 
     APPROX_WCS_KEY in cases where there is significant skewness
     between the axes.

   - fixed bug in ffgics that affected cases where the first coordinate
     axis was DEC, not RA, and the image was a mirror image of the sky.

   - fixed bug in ffhist when trying to read the default binning
     factor keyword, TDBIN.

   - modified ffhist so that is correctly computes the rotation angle
     in a 2-D image if the first histogram column has a CROTA type
     keyword but the 2nd column does not.

   - modified ffcpcl so that it preserves the comment fields on the
     TTYPE and TFORM keywords when the column is copied to a new file.

   - make small change to configure.in to support FreeBSD Linux 
     by setting CFLAGS = -Df2cFortran instead of -Dg77Fortran. Then
     regenerated configure with autoconf 2.13 instead of 2.12.     

Version 2.035 - 7 Dec 1999 (internal release only)

   - added new routine called fits_get_keyclass/ffgkcl that returns
     the general class of the keyword, e.g., required structural 
     keyword, WCS keyword, Comment keyword, etc.  15 classes of
     keywords have been defined in fitsio.h

   - added new routine called fits_get_img_parm/ffgipr that is similar
     to ffgphd but it only return the bitpix, naxis, and naxisn values.

   - added 3 new routines that support the long string keyword
     convention: fits_insert_key_longstr, fits_modify_key_longstr
     fits_update_key_longstr.

   - modified ffgphd which reads image header keywords to support
     the new experimental compressed image format.

   - when opening a .Z compressed file, CFITSIO tries to allocate
     memory equal to 3 times the file size, which may be excessive
     in some cases.  This was changed so that if the allocation fails,
     then CFITSIO will try again to allocate only enough memory
     equal to 1 times the file size.  More memory will be allocated
     later if this turns out to be too small.

   - improved the error checking in the fits_insert_key routine
     to check for illegal characters in the keyword.

Version 2.034 - 23 Nov 1999

   - enhanced support for the new 'CD' matrix world coordinate system
     keywords in the ffigics routine.  This routine has been enhanced
     to look for the new 'CD' keywords, if present, and convert them
     back to the old CDELTn and CROTAn values, which are then returned.  
     The routine will also swap the WCS parameters for the 2 axes if
     the declination-like axis is the first WCS axis.

   - modified ffphbn in putkey.c to support the 'U' and 'V" TFORM characters
     (which represent unsigned short and unsigned int columns) in variable
     length array columns.  (previously only supported these types in
     fixed length columns).

   - added checks when reading gzipped files to detect unexpected EOF.
     Previously, the 'inflate_codes' routine would just sit in an infinite 
     loop if the file ended unexpectedly.

   - modified fits_verify_chksum/ffvcks so that checksum keywords with
     a blank value string are treated as undefined, the same as
     if the keyword did not exist at all.

   - fixed ffghtb and ffghbn so that they return the extname value 
     in cases where there are no columns in the table.

   - fixed bug in the ffgtwcs routine (this is a little utility 
     routine to aid in interfacing to Doug Mink's WCS routines);
     it was not correctly padding the length of string-valued keywords
     in the returned string.

   - fixed bug in 'iraffits.c' that prevented Type-2 IRAF images from
     being correctly byte-swapped on PCs and DEC-OSF machines.

   - fixed tiny memory leak in irafncmp in iraffits.c.  Only relevant when
     reading IRAF .imh files.

   - fixed a bug (introduced in version 2.027) that caused the keyword
     reading routines to sometimes not find a matching keyword if the
     input name template used the '*' wildcard as the last character.
     (e.g., if input name = 'COMMENT*' then it would not find the
     'COMMMENT' keywords.  (It would have found longer keywords like
     'COMMENTX' correctly). The fix required a minor change to ffgcrd
     in getkey.c

   - modified the routine (ffswap8) that does byteswapping of
     double precision numbers.  Some linux systems have reported floating
     point exceptions because they were trying to interprete the bytes
     as a double before the bytes had been swapped.

   - fixed bug in the calculation of the position of the last byte
     in the string of bits to be read in ffgcxuk and ffgcxui.  This
     bug generally caused no harm, but could cause the routine to
     exit with an invalid error message about trying to read
     beyond the size of the field.

   - If a unix machine did not have '__unix__', 'unix', or  '__unix'
     C preprocessor symbols defined, then CFITSIO would correctly open
     one FITS file, but would not correctly open subsequent files. Instead
     it would think that the same file was being opened multiple times.
     This problem has only been seen on an IBM/AIX machine. The fits_path2url
     and fits_url2path routines in group.c were modified to fix the problem.

   - fixed bug in group.c, which affected WINDOWS platforms only, that 
     caused programs to go into infinite loop when trying to open
     certain files.

   - the ftrsim Fortran wrapper routine to ffrsim was not defined
     correctly, which caused the naxis(2) value to be passed incorrectly
     on Dec OSF machines, where sizeof(long) != sizeof(int).

Version 2.033 - 17 Sept 1999

   - New Feature: enhanced the row selection parser so that comparisons
     between values in different rows of the table are allowed, and the
     string comparisions with <, >, <=, and >= are supported.

   - added new routine the returns the name of the keyword in the
     input keyword record string.  The name is usually the first
     8 characters of the record, except if the HIERARCH convention
     is being used in which case the name may be up to 67 charcters
     long.

   - added new routine called fits_null_check/ffnchk that checks to
     see if the current header contains any null (ASCII 0) characters.
     These characters are illegal in FITS headers, but they go undetected
     by the other CFITSIO routines that read the header keywords.

   - the group.c file has been replaced with a new version as supplied
     by the ISDC.  The changes are mainly to support partial URLs and
     absolute URLs more robustly.  Host dependent directory paths are
     now converted to true URLs before being read from/written to
     grouping tables.

   - modified ffnmhd slightly so that it will move to the first extension
     in which either the EXTNAME or the HDUNAME keyword is equal to the
     user-specified name.  Previously, it only checked for HDUNAME if
     the EXTNAME keyword did not exist.

   - made small change to drvrnet.c so that it uncompress files 
     which end in .Z and .gz just as for ftp files.

   - rewrote ffcphd (copy header) to handle the case where the
     input and output HDU are in the same physical FITS file.

   - fixed bug in how long string keyword values (using the CONTINUE
     convention) were read.  If the string keyword value ended in an
     '&' character, then fits_read_key_longstr, fits_modify_key_str,
     and fits_delete_key would interpret the following keyword as
     a continuation, regardless of whether that keyword name was
     'CONTINUE' as required by this convention.  There was also a bug
     in that if the string keyword value was all blanks, then 
     fits_modify_key_str could in certain unusual cases think
     that the keyword ended in an '&' and go into an infinite loop.

   - modified ffgpv so that it calls the higher level ffgpv_ routine
     rather than directly calling the lower level ffgcl_ routine. This
     change is needed to eventually support reading compressed images.

   - added 3 new routines to get the image datatype, image dimensions,
     and image axes length.  These support the case where the image is
     compressed and stored in a binary table.

   - fixed bug in ffiblk that could sometimes cause it to insert a
     new block in a file somewhere in the middle of the data, instead
     of at the end of the HDU.  This fortunately is a rare problem,
     mainly only occuring in certain cases when  inserting rows in a binary 
     table that contains variable length array data (i.e., has a heap).

   - modified fits_write_tdim so that it double checks the TFORMn
     value directly if the column repeat count stored in the internal
     structure is not equal to the product of all the dimensions.

   - fixed bug that prevented ffitab or ffibin from inserting a new
     table after a null primary array (can't read NAXIS2 keyword).
     Required a small change to ffrdef.

   - modified testprog.c so that it will continue to run even if
     it cannot open or process the template file testprog.tpt.

   - modified the logic in lines 1182-1185 of grparser.c so that
     it returns the correct status value in case of an error.

   - added test in fitsio2.h to see if __sparcv9 is defined; this
     identifies a machine running Solaris 7 in 64-bit mode where
     long integers are 64 bits long.

Version 2.032 - 25 May 1999

   - the distribution .tar file was changed so that all the files
     will be untarred into a  subdirectory by default instead of
     into the current directory.

   - modified ffclos so that it always frees the space allocated by
     the fptr pointer, even when another fptr points to the same file.

   - plugged a potential (but rare in practice) memory leak in ffpinit

   - fixed bug in all the ffp3d_ and ffg3d_ routines in cases where
     the data cube that has been allocated in memory has more planes
     than the data cube in the FITS file.

   - modified drvrsmem.c so that it allocates a small shared
     memory segment only if CFITSIO tries to read or write a
     FITS file in shared memory.  Previously it always allocated
     the segment whether it was needed or not.  Also, this small
     segment is removed if 0 shared memory segments remain in 
     the system.

   - put "static" in front of 7 DECLARE macros in compress.c
     because these global variables were causing conflicts with other
     applications programs that had variables with the same names.

   - modified ffasfm to return datatype = TDOUBLE instead of TFLOAT
     if the ASCII table column has TFORMn = 'Ew.d' with d > 6.

   - modified the column reading routines to a) print out the offending
     entry if an error occurs when trying to read a numeric ASCII table
     column, and b) print out the column number that had the error
     (the messages are written to CFITSIOs error stack)

   - major updates to the Fortran FITSIO User's Guide to include many
     new functions that have been added to CFITSIO in the past year.

   - modified fitsio2.h so that the test for __D_FLOAT etc. is only
     made on Alpha VMS machines, to avoid syntax errors on some other
     platforms.

   - modified ffgthd so that it recognizes a floating point value
     that uses the 'd' or 'D' exponent character.

   - removed the range check in fftm2s that returned an error if
     'decimals' was less than zero.  A negative value is OK and is
     used to return only the date and not the time in the string.

Version 2.031 - 31 Mar 1999

   - moved the code that updates the NAXIS2 and PCOUNT keywords from
     ffchdu into the lower lever ffrdef routine.  This ensures that
     other routines which call ffrdef will correctly update these 2
     keywords if required.  Otherwise, for instance, calling 
     fits_write_checksum before closing the HDU could cause the NAXIS2
     keyword (number of rows in the table) to not be updated.

   - fixed bug (introduced in version 2.030) when writing null values
     to a primary array or image extention.  If trying to set more
     than 1 pixel to null at a time, then typically only 1 null would
     be written.  Also fixed related bug when writing null values to
     rows in a table that are beyond the currently defined size of the
     table (the size of the table was not being expanded properly).

   - enhanced the extended filename parser to support '*' in image
     section specifiers, to mean use the whole range of the axis.
     myfile.fits[*,1:100] means use the whole range of the first
     axis and pixels 1 to 100 in the second axis.  Also supports
     an increment, as in myfile.fits[*:2, *:2] to use just the
     odd numbered rows and columns.

   - modified fitscore.c to set the initial max size of the header, when
     first reading it, to the curent size of the file, rather than to 
     2 x 10**9 to avoid rare cases where CFITSIO ends up writing a huge 
     file to disk.

   - modified file_compress_open so that it will not allow a compressed
     FITS file to be opened with write access.  Otherwise, a program
     could write to the temporary copy of the uncompressed file, but
     the modification would be lost when the program exits.

Version 2.030 - 24 Feb 1999

   - fixed bug in ffpclu when trying to write a null value to a row
     beyond the current size of the table (wouldn't append new rows
     like it should).

   - major new feature:  enhanced the routines that read ASCII string
     columns in tables so that they can read any table column, including
     logical and numeric valued columns.  The column values are returned
     as a formated string.  The format is determined by the TDISPn
     keyword if present, otherwise a default format based on the
     datatype of the column is used.

  -  new routine:  fits_get_col_display_width/ffgcdw returns the length
     of the formated strings that will be returned by the routines that
     read table columns as strings. 

   - major new feature:  added support for specifying an 'image section'
     when opening an image:  e.g,  myfile.fits[1:512:2,2:512:2] to 
     open a 256x256 pixel image consisting of the odd columns and the 
     even numbered rows of the input image.

   - added supporting project files and instructions for building 
     CFITSIO under Windows NT with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

   - changed the variable 'template' to 'templt' in testprog.c since
     it conflicted with a reserved word on some compilers.

   - modified group.c to conditionally include sys/stat.h only on
     unix platforms

   - fixed bug in the ffiter iterator function that caused it to always
     pass 'firstn' = 1 to the work function when reading from the
     primary array or IMAGE extension. It worked correctly for tables.

   - fixed bug in the template header keyword parser (ffgthd) in cases
     where the input template line contains a logical valued keyword
     (T or F) without any following comment string.  It was previously
     interpreting this as a string-valued keyword.

   - modified ffrhdu that reads and opens a new HDU, so that it
     ignores any leading blank characters in the XTENSION name, e.g.,
     XTENSION= '  BINTABLE' will not cause any errors, even though
     this technically violates the FITS Standard.

   - modified ffgtbp that reads the required table keywords to make
     it more lenient and not exit with an error if the THEAP keyword
     in binary tables cannot be read as an integer.  Now it will
     simply ignore this keyword if it cannot be read.

   - added test for 'WIN32' as well as '__WIN32__' in fitsio2.h,
     eval.l and eval_l.c in a preprocessor statement.

   - changed definition of strcasecmp and strncasecmp in fitsio2.h,
     eval.l and eval_l.c to conform to the function prototypes under
     the Alpha VMS v7.1 compiler.

   - corrected the long function names in longnam.h for the new WCS 
     utility functions in wcssubs.c

Version 2.029 - 11 Feb 1999

   - fixed bug in the way NANs and underflows were being detected on
     VAX and Alpha VMS machines.

   - enhanced the filename parser to distinguish between a VMS-style
     directory name (e.g.  disk:[directory]myfile.fits) and a CFITSIO
     filter specifier at the end of the name.

   - modified ffgthd to support the HIERARCH convention for keyword
     names that are longer than 8 characters or contain characters
     that would be illegal in standard FITS keyword names.

   - modified the include statements in grparser.c so that malloc.h 
     and memory.h are only included on the few platforms that really
     need them.

   - modified the file_read routine in drvrfile.c to ignore the last
     record in the FITS file it it only contains a single character that
     is equal to 0, 10 or 32.  Text editors sometimes append a character
     like this to the end of the file, so CFITSIO will ignore it and
     treat it as if it had reached the end of file.

   - minor modifications to fitsio.h to help support the ROOT environment.

   - installed new version of group.c and group.h; the main change
     is to support relative paths (e.g.  "../filename") in the URLs

   - modified the histogramming routines so that it looks for the
     default preferred column axes in a keyword of the form
     CPREF = 'Xcol, Ycol'
     instead of separate keywords of the form
     CPREF1 = 'Xcol'
     CPREF2 = 'Ycol'

   - fixed bug so that if the binning spec is just a single integer,
     as in  [bin 4] then this will be interpreted as meaning to make
     a 2D histogram using the preferred or default axes, with the
     integer taken as the binning factor in both axes.

Version 2.028 - 27 Jan 1999

   - if the TNULLn keyword value was outside the range of a 'I' or 'B'
     column, an overflow would occur when setting the short or char 
     to the TNULLn value, leading to incorrect values being flagged as
     being undefined.  This has been fixed so that CFITSIO will ignore
     TNULLn values that are beyond the range of the column data type.

   - changed a few instances of the string {"\0"} to {'\0'} in the
     file groups.c

   - installed new version of the grparser.c file from the ISDC

   - added new WCS support routines (in wcssub.c) which make it easier
     to call Doug Mink's WCSlib routines for converting between plate
     and sky coordinates.   The CFITSIO routines themselves never
     call a WCSlib routine, so CFITSIO is not dependent on WCSlib.

   - modified  ffopen so that if you use the extended filename
     syntax to both select rows in a table and then bin columns into
     a histogram, then CFITSIO will simply construct an array listing
     the good row numbers to be used when making the histogram,
     instead of making a whole new temporary FITS file containing
     the selected rows.

   - modified ffgphd which parses the primary array header keywords
     when opening a file, to not choke on minor format errors in 
     optional keywords.  Otherwise, this prevents CFITSIO from
     even opening the file.

   - changed a few more variable declarations in compress.c from global
     to static.

Version 2.027 - 12 Jan 1999

   - modified the usage of the output filename specifier so that it,
       a) gives the name of the binned image, if specified, else,
       b) gives the name of column filtered and/or row filtered table, if 
          specified, else
       c) is the name for a local copy of the ftp or http file, else,
       d) is the name for the local uncompressed version of the compressed
          FITS file, else,
       e) the output filename is ignored.

   - fixed minor bug in ffcmps, when comparing 2 strings while using
     a '*' wild card character.

   - fixed bug in ftgthd that affected cases where the template string
     started with a minus sign and contained 2 tokens (to rename a
     keyword).

   - added support for the HIERARCH keyword convention for reading 
     and writing keywords longer than 8 characters or that contain
     ASCII characters not allowed in normal FITS keywords. 

   - modified the extended filename syntax to support opening images
     that are contained in a single cell of a binary table with syntax:
     filename.fits[extname; col_name(row_expression)]

Version 2.026 - 23 Dec 1998

   - modified the group parser to:
     a) support CFITSIO_INCLUDE_FILES environment variable, which can
     point to the location of template files, and, 
     b) the FITS file parameter passed to the parser no longer has to point
     to an empty file.  If there are already HDUs in the file, then the
     parser appends new HDUs to the end of the file.

   - make a small change to the drvrnet.c file to accommodate creating
     a static version of the CFITSIO library.

   - added 2 new routines to read consecutive bits as an unsigned integer 
     from a Bit 'X' or Byte 'B' column (ffgcxui and ffgcxuk).

   - modified the logic for determining histogram boundaries in ffhisto
     to add one more bin by default, to catch values that are right on
     the upper boundary of the histogram, or are in the last partial bin.

   - modified cfitsio2.h to support the new Solaris 7 64-bit mode operating
     system.

   - Add utility routine, CFits2Unit, to the Fortran wrappers which searches
     the gFitsFiles array for a fptr, returning its element (Fortran unit
     number), or allocating a new element if one doesn't already
     exists... for C calling Fortran calling CFITSIO.

   - modified configure so that it does not use the compiler optimizer
     when using gcc 2.8.x on Linux

   - (re)added the fitsio.* documentation files that describe the
     Fortran-callable FITSIO interface to the C routines.

   - modified the lexical parser in eval_f.c to fix bug in null detections
     and bug in ffsrow when nrows = 0.

   - modified ffcalc so that it creates a TNULLn keyword if appropriate 
     when a new column is created.  Also fixed detection of OVERFLOWs
     so that it ignores null values.

   - added hyperbolic trig and rounding functions to
     the lexical parser in the eval* files.

   - improved error message that gets written when the group number is
     out of range when reading a 'random groups' array.

   - added description of shared memory, grouping, and template parsing
     error messages to ffgerr and to the User's Guide.  Moved the error
     code definitions from drvsmem.h to fitsio.h.

   - modified grparser.c to compile correctly on Alpha/OSF machines

   - modifed drvrnet.c to eliminate compiler warnings

   - Modified Makefile.in to include targets for building all the sample
     programs that are included with CFITSIO.

Version 2.025 - 1 Dec 1998

   - modified ffgphd and ffgtbp so that they ignores BLANK and TNULLn keywords
     that  do not have a valid integer value.  Also, any error while reading
     the BSCALE, BZERO, TSCALn, or TZEROn keywords will be ignored.  
     Previously, CFITSIO would have simply refused to read an HDU that had 
     such an invalid keyword.

   - modified the parser in eval_f.c to accept out of order times in GTIs

   - updated cfitsio_mac.sit.hqx to fix bad target parameters for Mac's
     speed test program

   - modified template parser in grparser.c to: 1) not write GRPNAME keyword
     twice, and 2) assign correct value for EXTVERS keyword.

   - fixed minor bugs in group.c; mainly would only affect users of the
     INTEGRAL Data Access Layer.

   - temporarily removed the prototype for ffiwcs from fitsio.h until
     full WCS support is added to CFITSIO in the near future.

   - modified the HTTP driver to send a User-Agent string:
     HEASARC/CFITSIO/<version number>

   - declared local variables in compress.c as 'static' to avoid
     conflicts with other libraries.

Version 2.024 - 9 Nov 1998

   - added new function fits_url_type which returns the driver prefix string
     associated with a particular FITS file pointer.

Version 2.023 - 1 Nov 1998 - first full release of CFITSIO 2.0

   - slightly modified the way real keyword values are formated, to ensure
     that it includes a decimal point.  E.g.,  '1.0E-09' instead of '1E-09'

   - added new funtion to support template files when creating new FITS files.

   - support the TCROTn WCS keyword in tables, when reading the WCS keywords.

   - modified the iterator to support null values in logical columns in
     binary tables.

   - fixed bug in iterator to support null values in integer columns in
     ASCII tables.

   - changed the values for FLOATNULLVALUE and DOUBLENULLVALUE to make them
     less likely to duplicate actual values in the data.

   - fixed major bug when freeing memory in the iterator function.  It caused
     mysterious crashes on a few platforms, but had no effect on most others.

   - added support for reading IRAF format image (.imh files)

   - added more error checking to return an error if the size of the FITS
     file exceeds the largest value of a long integer (2.1 GB on 32-bit
     platforms).

   - CFITSIO now will automatically insert space for additional table rows
     or add space to the data heap, if one writes beyond the current end
     of the table or heap.  This prevents any HDUs which might follow
     the current HDU from being overwritten.  It is thus no longer necessary
     to explicitly call fits_insert_rows before writing new rows of data
     to the FITS file.

   - CFITSIO now automatically keeps track of the number of rows that have
     been written to a FITS table, and updates the NAXIS2 keyword accordingly
     when the table is closed.  It is no longer necessary for the application
     program to updated NAXIS2.  

   - When reading from a FITS table, CFITSIO will now return an error if the
     application tries to read beyond the end of the table. 

   - added 2 routines to get the number of rows or columns in a table.

   - improved the undocumented feature that allows a '20A' column to be
     read as though it were a '20B' column by fits_read_col_byt.  

   - added overflow error checking when reading keywords.  Previously, the
     returned value could be silently truncated to the maximum allowed value
     for that data type.  Now an error status is returned whenever an 
     overflow occurs.

   - added new set of routines dealing with hierarchical groups of files.
     These were provided by Don Jennings of the INTEGRAL Science Data Center.

   - added new URL parsing routines.

   - changed the calling sequence to ffghad (get HDU address) from
     ffghad(fitsfile *fptr, > long *headstart, long *dataend) to
     ffghad(fitsfile *fptr, > long *headstart, long datastart, 
            long *dataend, int *status) 

   - major modification to support opening the same FITS file more
     than once.  Now one can open the same file multiple times and
     read and write simulataneously to different HDUs within the file.
     fits_open_file automatically detects if the file is already opened.

   - added the ability to clobber/overwrite an existing file
     with the same name when creating a new output file.  Just
     preceed the output file name with '!' (an exclamation mark)

   - changed the ffpdat routine which writes the DATE keyword
     to use the new 'YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss' format.

   - added several new routines to create or parse the new date/time
     format string.

   - changed ifdef for DECFortran in f77_wrap.h and f77_wrap1.c:
     expanded to recognize Linux/Alpha

   - added new lexical parsing routines (from Peter Wilson):
     eval_l.c, eval_y.c, eval_f.c, eval_defs.h, and eval_tab.h.
     These are used when doing on-the-fly table row selections.

   - added new family of routines to support reading and writing
     'unsigned int' data type values in keywords, images or tables.

   - restructured all the putcol and getcol routines to provide
     simpler and more robust support for machines which have
     sizeof(long) = 8.  Defined a new datatype INT32BIT which is
     always 32 bits long (platform independent) and is used internally
     in CFITSIO when reading or writing BITPIX = 32 images or 'J'
     columns.  This eliminated the need for specialize routines like
     ffswaplong, ffunswaplong, and ffpacklong.

   - overhauled cfileio.c (and other files) to use loadable drivers for
     doing data I/O to different devices.  Now CFITSIO support network 
     access to ftp:// and http:// files, and to shared memory files.

   - removed the ffsmem routine and replaced it with ffomem.  This will
     only affect software that reads an existing file in core memory.
     (written there by some other process).

   - modified all the ffgkn[] routines (get an array of keywords) so
     that the 'nfound' parameter is = the number of keywords returned,
     not the highest index value on the returned keywords.  This makes
     no difference if the starting index value to look for = 1.
     This change is not backward compatible with previous versions
     of CFITSIO, but is the way that FITSIO behaved.

   - added new error code = 1 for any application error external
     to CFITSIO.  Also reports "unknown error status" if the
     value doesn't match a known CFITSIO error.

Version 1.42 - 30 April 1998 (included in FTOOLS 4.1 release)

   - modified the routines which read a FITS float values into
     a float array, or read FITS double values into a double array,
     so that the array value is also explicitly set in addition
     to setting the array of flag values, if the FITS value is a NaN.
     This ensures that no NaN values get passed back to the calling
     program, which can cause serious problems on some platforms (OSF).

   - added calls to ffrdef at the beginning of the insert
     or delete rows or columns routines in editcol.c to make sure
     that CFITSIO has correctly initialized the HDU information.

   - added new routine ffdrws to delete a list of rows in a table

   - added ffcphd to copy the header keywords from one hdu to another

   - made the anynul parameter in the ffgcl* routines optional
     by first checking to see if the pointer is not null before
     initializing it.

   - modified ffbinit and ffainit to ignore minor format
     errors in header keywords so that cfitsio can at least
     move to an extension that contains illegal keywords.

   - modified all the ffgcl* routines to simply return without
     error if nelem = 0.

   - added check to ffclose to check the validity of the fitsfile
     pointer before closing it.  This should prevent program crashes
     when someone tries to close the same file more than once.

   - replaced calls to strcmp and strncmp with macros FSTRCMP and
     FSTRNCMP in a few places to improve performance when reading
     header keywords (suggested by Mike Noble)

  Bug Fixes:

   - fixed typo in macro definition of error 504 in the file fitsio.h.

   - in ffopen, reserved space for 4 more characters in the input
     file name in case a '.zip' suffix needs to be added.

   - small changes to ffpclx to fix problems when writing bit (X) data
     columns beyond the current end of file.

   - fixed small bug in ffcrhd where a dummy pointer was not initialized

   - initialized the dummy variable in ffgcfe and ffgcfd which
     was causing crashes under OSF in some cases.

   - increased the length of the allocated string ffgkls by 2
     to support the case of reading a numeric keyword as a string
     which doesn't have the enclosing quote characters.

Version 1.4 - 6 Feb 1998 

   - major restructuring of the CFITSIO User's Guide

   - added the new 'iterator' function.  The fortran wrapper is
     in f77_iter.c for now.

   - enhanced ffcrtb so that it writes a dummy primary array
     if none currently exists before appending the table.

   - removed the ffgcl routine and replaced it with ffgcvl 

   - modified ffpcnl to just take a single input null value instead
     of an entire array of null value flags.

   - modified ffcmps and ffgnxk so that, for example, the string 'rate' 
     is not considered a match to the string 'rate2', and 'rate*'
     is a match to the string 'rate'.

   - modified ffgrsz to also work with images, in which case
     it returns the optimum number of pixels to process at
     one time.

   - modified ffgthd to support null valued keywords

   - added a new source file 'f77_wrap.c' that includes all the
     Fortran77 wrapper routines for calling CFITSIO.  This will
     eventually replace the Fortran FITSIO library.

   - added new routines:
     ffppn - generic write primary array with null values
     ffpprn - write null values to primary array

     ffuky - 'update' a keyword value, with any specified datatype.

     ffrprt - write out report of error status and error messages
     ffiter - apply a user function iteratively to all the rows of a table
     ffpkyc - write complex-valued keyword
     ffpkym - write double complex-valued keyword
     ffpkfc - write complex-valued keyword in fixed format
     ffpkfm - write double complex-valued keyword in fixed format

     ffgkyc - read complex-valued keyword
     ffgkym - read double complex-valued keyword

     ffmkyc - modify complex-valued keyword
     ffmkym - modify double complex-valued keyword
     ffmkfc - modify complex-valued keyword in fixed format
     ffmkfm - modify double complex-valued keyword in fixed format

     ffukyc - update complex-valued keyword
     ffukym - update double complex-valued keyword
     ffukfc - update complex-valued keyword in fixed format
     ffukfm - update double complex-valued keyword in fixed format

     ffikyc - insert complex-valued keyword
     ffikym - insert double complex-valued keyword
     ffikfc - insert complex-valued keyword in fixed format
     ffikfm - insert double complex-valued keyword in fixed format

     ffpktp - write or modify keywords using ASCII template file
     ffcpcl - copy a column from one table to another
     ffcpky - copy an indexed keyword from one HDU to another
     ffpcnl - write logical values, including nulls, to binary table
     ffpcns - write string values,  including nulls, to table
     ffmnhd - move to HDU with given exttype, EXTNAME and EXTVERS values
     ffthdu - return the total number of HDUs in the file
     ffghdt - return the type of the  CHDU
     ffflnm - return the name of the open FITS file
     ffflmd - return the mode of the file (READONLY or READWRITE)

   - modified ffmahd and ffmrhd (to move to a new extension) so that
     a null pointer may be given for the returned HDUTYPE argument.

   - worked around a bug in the Mac CWpro2 compiler by changing all
     the statements like "#if BYTESWAPPED == TRUE" to "if BYTESWAPPED".

   - modified ffitab (insert new ASCII table) to allow tables with
     zero number of columns

   - modified Makefile.in and configure to define the -Dg77Fortran
     CFLAGS variable on Linux platforms.  This is needed to 
     compile the new f77_wrap.c file (which includes cfortran.h)

  Bug Fixes:

   - fixed small bug in ffgrz (get optimum row size) which sometimes
     caused it to return slightly less than the maximum optimum size.
     This bug would have done no harm to application programs.

   - fixed bug in ffpclk and ffgclk to add an 'else' case
     if size of int is not equal to size of short or size of long.

   - added test to ffgkls to check if the input string is not null before
     allocating memory for it.

Version 1.32 - 21 November 1997 (internal release only)

   - fixed bug in the memory deallocation (free) statements
     in the ffopen routine in the cfileio.c file.

   - modified ffgphd to tolerate minor violations of the FITS 
     standard in the format of the XTENSION = 'IMAGE   '
     keyword when reading FITS files.  Extra trailing spaces
     are now allowed in the keyword value.  (FITS standard
     will be changed so that this is not a violation).

Version 1.31 - 4 November 1997 (internal release only)

  Enhancements:

   - added support for directly reading compressed FITS files
     by copying the algorithms from the gzip program. This 
     supports the Unix compress, gzip and pkzip algorithms.

   - modified ffiimg, ffitab, and ffibin (insert HDUs into
     a FITS file) so that if the inserted HDU is at the end of
     the FITS file, then it simply appends a new empty HDU
     and writes the required keywords.  This allows space
     to be reserved for additional keywords in the header
     if desired.

   - added the ffchfl and ffcdfl routines to check the header and
     data fill values, for compatibility with the Fortran FITSIO
     library.

   - added the ffgsdt routine to return the system date
     for compatibility with the Fortran FITSIO library.

   - added a diagnostic error message (written to the error stack)
     if the routines that read data from image or column fail.

   - modified ffgclb so that it simply copies the bytes from 
     an ASCII 'nA' or 'An' format column into the user's byte
     array.  Previously, CFITSIO would return an error when 
     trying to read an 'A' column with ffgclb.

   - modified ffpclb so that it simply copies the input array 
     of bytes to an ASCII 'nA' or 'An' format column.
     Previously, CFITSIO would return an error when 
     trying to write to an 'A' column with ffpclb.

  Bug Fixes:

   - ffgkls was allocating one too few bytes when reading continued
     string keyword values. 

   - in testprog.c added code to properly free the memory that
     had been allocated for string arrays.

   - corrected typographical errors in the User's Guide.

Version 1.30 - 11 September 1997

   - major overhaul to support reading and writing FITS files
     in memory.   The new routines fits_set_mem_buff and 
     fits_write_mem_buff have been added to intialize and
     copy out the memory buffer, respectively.

   - added support for reading FITS files piped in on 'stdin'
     and piped out on 'stdout'.  Just specify the file name as '-'
     when opening or creating the FITS file.

   - added support for 64-bit SGI IRIX machines.  This required
     adding routines to pack and unpack 32-bit integers into
     64-bit integers.

   - cleaned up the code that supports G_FLOAT and IEEE_FLOAT
     on Alpha VMS systems.  Now, the type of float is determined
     at compile time, not run time.

  Bug Fixes:

   - replaced the malloc calls in the error message stack routines
     with a static fixed size array.  The malloc's cause more
     problems than they solved, and were prone to cause memory
     leaks if users don't clear the error message stack when
     closing the FITS file.

   - when writing float or double keywords, test that the value
     is not a special IEEE value such as a NaN.  Some
     compilers would write the string 'NaN' in this case into
     the output value string.

   - fixed bug in ffiblk, to ignore EOF status return if it is
     inserting blocks at the end of the file.

   - removed the 'l' from printf format string that is constructed
     in the ffcfmt routine.  This 'l' is non-standard and causes problems
     with the Metrowerks compiler on a Mac.

   - the default null value in images was mistakenly being set
     equal to NO_NULL = 314, rather than NULL_UNDEFINED = 1234554321
     in the ffgphd routine.

   - check status value in ffgkls to make sure the keyword exists
     before allocating memeory for the value string.

   - fixed the support for writing and reading unsigned long integer
     keyword values in ffpky and ffgky by internally treating
     the values as doubles.  This required changes to ffc2r and
     ffc2d as well.

   - added explicit cast to 'double' in one place in putcolb.c and
     6 places in pubcolui.c, to get rid of warning messages issued
     by one compiler.

   - in ffbinit and ffainit, it is necessary to test that tfield > 0
     before trying to allocate memory with calloc.  Otherwise, some
     compilers return a null pointer which CFITSIO interprets to 
     mean the memory allocation failed.

   - had to explicitly cast the null buffer pointer to a char
     pointer (cptr = (char *)buffer;) in 4 places in the buffers.c
     file to satisfy a picky C++ compiler.

   - changed the test for an ALPHA VMS system to see if
     '__VMS' is defined, rather than 'VMS'.  The latter
     is not defined by at least one C++ compiler.

   - modified ffpcls so that it can write a null string to
     a variable length string column, without going into
     an infinite loop.

   - fixed bug in ffgcfl that caused the 'next' variable to be
     incremented twice.

   - fixed bug in ffgcpr that caused it write 2x the number of
     complex elements into the descriptor when writing to
     a complex or double complex variable length array column.

   - added call to ffrdef at the end of ffrsim to ensure that
     the internal structures are updated to correspond to the
     modified header keywords

Version 1.25 - 7 July 1997

   - improved the efficiency of the ffiblk routine, when inserting
     more than one block into the file.

   - fixed bug in ffwend that in rare instances caused the beginning
     of the following extension to be overwritten by blank fill.

   - added new routine to modify the size of an existing primary
     array or image extension: fits_resize_img/ffrsim.

   - added support for null-valued keywords, e.g., keywords that
     have no defined value.  These keywords have an equal sign and
     space in columns 9-10, but have not value string.  Example:
     KEYNAME =                      / null-valued keyword
     Support for this feature required the following changes:
       - modified ffpsvc to return a null value string without error
       - modified ffc2[ilrd] to return error VALUE_UNDEFINED in this case
       - modified ffgkn[sljed] to continue reading additional keywords
         even if one or more keywords have undefined values.
       - added 4 new routines:  ffpkyu, ffikyu, ffmkyu, ffukyu to
         write, insert, modify, or update an undefined keyword

   - a new makefile.os2 file was added, for building CFITSIO
     on OS/2 systems.

   - modified ffgtkn so that if it finds an unexpected keyword
     name, the returned error status = BAD_ORDER instead of
     NOT_POS_INT.

   - added 2 new routines, fits_write_key_unit/ffpunt and
     fits_read_key_unit/ffgunt to write/read the physical
     units of a keyword value.  These routines use a local
     FITS convention for storing the units in square brackets
     following the '/' comment field separator, as in:
     VELOCITY=                   12 / [km/s] orbit speed 
     The testprog.c program was modified to test these
     new routines.

   - in the test of Alpha OSF/1 machines in fitsio2.h,
     change 'defined(unix)' to 'defined(__unix__)' which
     appears to be a more robust test.

   - remove test for linux environment variable from fitsio2.h

Version 1.24 - 2 May 1997

   - fixed bug in ffpbyt that incorrectly computed the current
     location in the FITS file when writing > 10000 bytes.

   - changed the datatype of the 'nbytes' parameter in ffpbyt 
     from 'int' to 'long'.   Made corresponding datatype change
     to some internal variables in ffshft.

   - changed '(unsigned short *)' to '(short *)' in getcolui.c, and
     changed '(unsigned long *)'  to '(long *)'  in getcoluj.c, to
     work around problem with the VAX/VMS cc compiler.

Version 1.23 - 24 April 1997

   - modified ffcins and ffdins (in editcol.c) to simply return 
     without error if there are no (zero) rows in the table.

Version 1.22 - 18 April 1997

   - fixed bug in ffgcpr that caused it to think that all values were
     undefined in ASCII tables columns that have TNULLn = '        '
     (i.e., the TNULLn keyword value is a string of blanks.

   - fixed bug in the ffgcl[bdeijk,ui,uj] family of routines
     when parsing a numeric value in an ASCII table.  The
     returned values would have the decimal place shifted to
     the left if the table field contained an explicit decimal
     point followed by blanks.  Example:  in an F5.2 column,
     the value '16.  ' would be returned as 0.16.  If the
     trailing zeros were present, then cfitsio returned the
     correct value (e.g.,  '16.00' returns 16.).

   - fixed another bug in the ffgcl[bdeijk,ui,uj] family of routines
     that caused them to misread values in an ASCII table in rows
     following an undefined value when all the values were read
     at once in a single call to the routine.

Version 1.21 - 26 March 1997

   - added general support for reading and writing unsigned integer
     keywords, images, and binary table column values.

   - fixed bug in the way the column number was used in ffgsve and
     similar routines.  This bug caused cfitsio to read (colnum - 1)
     rather than the desired column.

   - fixed a bug in ftgkls that prevented it from reading more than one
     continuation line of a long string keyword value.

   - fixed the definition of fits_write_longwarn in longnam.h

Version 1.20 - 29 Jan 1997

   - when creating a binary table with variable length vector columns, if the
     calling routine does not specify a value for the maximum length of
     the vector (e.g.,  TFORMn = '1PE(400)')  then cfitsio will automatically
     calculate the maximum value and append it to the TFORM value
     when the binary table is first closed.

   - added the set of routines to do coordinate system transformations

   - added support for wildcards ('*', '?', and '#') in the input
     keyword name when reading, modifying, or deleting keywords.

   - added new general keyword reading routine, ffgnxk, to return
     the next keyword whose name matches a list of template names,
     but does not match any names on a second template list.

   - modified ftgrec so that it simply moves to the beginning
     of the header if the input keyword number = 0

   - added check in ffdelt to make sure the input fits file pointer is
     not already null

   - added check in ffcopy to make sure the output HDU does not
     already contain any keywords (it must be empty).

   - modified ffgcls so that it does not test if each string column
     value equals the null string value if the null string value
     is longer than the width of the column.

   - fixed bug in ftgtdm that caused it to fail if the TDIMn 
     keyword did not exist in the FITS file

   - modified testprog.c to include tests of keyword wildcards
     and the WCS coordinate transformation routines.

   - added a test for 'EMX' in fitsio2.h so that cfitsio builds 
     correctly on a PC running OS/2.

Version 1.11 - 04 Dec 1996

   - modified the testprog.c program that is included with the
     distribution, so that the output FITS file is identical to
     that produced by the Fortran FITSIO test program.

   - changed all instances of the 'extname' variable to 'extnm'
     to avoid a conflict with the -Dextname switch in cfortran.h
     on HP machines.

   - in all the routines like ffi4fi1, which convert an array
     of values to integers just prior to writing them to the FITS
     file, the integer value is now rounded to the nearest integer
     rather than truncated. (ffi4fi1, ffi4fi2, ffi4fi4, etc)

   - changed ffgcfl (and hence ffgcl) so that the input value
     of the logical array element is not changed if the corresponding
     FITS value is undefined.

   - in ffgacl, the returned value of TBCOL was off by 1 (too small)

   - fixed the comment of EXTNAME keyword to read 'binary table'
     instead of 'ASCII table' in the header of binary tables.

Version 1.101 - 17 Nov 1996

   - Made major I/O efficiency improvements by adding internal buffers
     rather than directly reading or writing to disk.  Access to 
     columns in binary tables is now 50 - 150 times faster.  Access to
     FITS image is also slightly faster.

   - made significant speed improvements when reading numerical data
     in FITS ASCII tables by writing my own number parsing routines
     rather than using the sscanf C library routine.  This change
     requires that the -lm argument now be included when linking
     a program that calls cfitsio (under UNIX).

   - regrouped the source files into logically related sets of routines.
     The Makefile now runs much faster since every single routine is
     not split into a separate file.

   - now use the memcpy function, rather than a 'for' loop in several
     places for added efficiency

   - redesigned the low-level binary table read and write routines
     (ffpbytoff and ffgbytoff) for greater efficiency.

   - added a new error status: 103 = too many open FITS files.

   - added a 'extern "C"' statement around the function prototypes
     in fitsio.h, to support use of cfitsio by C++ compilers.

   - fixed routines for writing or reading fixed-length substrings
     within a binary table ASCII column, with TFORM values of
     of the form 'rAw' where 'r' is the total width of the ASCII
     column and 'w' is the width of a substring within the column.

   - no longer automatically rewrite the END card and following fill
     values if they are already correct.

   - all the 'get keyword value and comment' routines have been changed 
     so that the comment is not returned if the input pointer is NULL.

   - added new routine to return the optimum number of tables rows
     that should be read or written at one time for optimum efficiency.

   - modified the way numerical values in ASCII tables are parsed so
     that embedded spaces in the value are ignored, and implicit
     decimal points are now supported.   (e.g, the string '123E 12'
     in a 'E10.2' format column will be interpreted as 1.23 * 10**12).

   - modified ffpcl and ffgcl to support binary table columns of
     all datatype (added logical, bit, complex, and double complex)

   - when writing numerical data to ASCII table columns, the ffpcl_
     routines now return an overflow error if a value is too large
     to be expressed in the column format.

   - closed small memory leak in ffpcls.

   - initialized the 'incre' variable in ffgcpr to eliminate compiler warning.

Version 1.04 - 17 Sept 1996

   - added README.MacOS and cfitsio_mac.sit.hqx to the distribution
     to support the Mac platforms.

   - fixed bug in ffpdfl that caused an EOF error (107) when a program
     creats a new extention that is an exact multiple of 2880 bytes long,
     AND the program does not write a value to the last element
     in the table or image.

   - fixed bug in all the ffgsf* and ffgcv* routines which caused
     core dumps when reading null values in a table.

Version 1.03 - 20 August 1996

   - added full support for reading and writing the C 'int'
     data type.  This was a problem on Alpha/OSF where short,
     int, and long datatypes are 2, 4, and 8 bytes long, respectively.

   - cleaned up the code in the byte-swapping routines.

   - renamed the file 'longname.h' to 'longnam.h' to avoid conflict
     with a file with the same name in another unrelated package.

Version 1.02 - 15 August 1996

   - ffgtbp was not correctly reading the THEAP keyword, hence would
     not correctly read variable length data in binary tables if
     the heap was not at the default starting location (i.e., 
     starting immediately after the fixed length table).

   - now force the cbuff variable in ffpcl_ and ffgcl_ to be
     aligned on a double word boundary.  Non-alignment can
     cause program to crash on some systems.

Version 1.01 - 12 August 1996

   - initial public release
